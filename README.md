# Alternatives
> Think on Zero Hunger, Focus on Nutrition

The exisisting, focused agricultural systems are busy in producing staple grains rather than producing diverse and healthier foods. The pandemic along with critical climate emergency makes us to re-think food systems. Spirulina, the blue green algae, with it's immense source of protein, essential nutrients, could fulfil the dietary needs and help protect  malnutrition  of billions of people in our over populated planet. It could be an alternative to meat or soya farming. Farming of spirulina can protect fragile ecosystems by reducing Carbon emission, treat Nuclear waste, and can produce renewable bio-fuel to produce the global energy in future.
